    "dream_optimization": "To address the violation and adhere to the MirrorDNA principles of Trust, Continuity, and Reflection, we need to ensure that sensitive information such as API keys is not hardcoded into the code. Instead, it should be stored securely and accessed dynamically. Here's a revised version:\n\n```python\ndef good_code():\n    # Securely retrieve the API key from an environment variable or secure vault\n    import os\n\n    api_key = os.getenv('MIRRORDNA_API_KEY', 'default_api_key')  # Default value if not set\n    \n    # Example usage of the API key (replace with actual logic)\n    print(f\"Using API Key: {api_key}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Trust**: By using environment variables or a secure vault, we ensure that sensitive information is stored securely and not hardcoded in the source code.\n2. **Continuity**: The revised function maintains the original logic of retrieving an API key but ensures it's done in a more secure manner.\n3. **Reflection**: The code reflects best practices for handling secrets in Python applications, which helps maintain the integrity and security of the system.\n\nThis approach aligns with MirrorDNA principles by ensuring that sensitive information is managed securely while maintaining the original functionality of the code."
